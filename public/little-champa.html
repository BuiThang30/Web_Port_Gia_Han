        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">In Champa, the word “Cham” in Vietnamese means diligent. And I remember how my instructor used that word as a nickname to signify I was one of the Champa for being “Cham,” for working hard.</p>

        <p>“Little Champa” was the name given to me on my first day in pottery class, when I showed up empty-handed, clutching a plastic spoon instead of proper tools. Rather than scold me, my teacher laughed and said that every tool finds its mound of clay. It was a mercy, really, because not long after, I came to work with Bau Truc clay from Ninh Thuan – stubborn, coarse, and perfectly matched to my rustic, unsophisticated artistry.</p>

        <p>Don’t misinterpret our journey as unendearing. For the first time seeing it, I was deceived by its dark and rich like deep soil too. But as soon as I picked it up, thick and mushy in my hands, feeling like grabbing a lump of wet earth after rain, I was totally weirded out! But that’s the fun of it. You can’t rush the clay: you have to move at its pace, pressing slowly, turning gently, letting its quirks guide you. What I love most is how this clay remembers everything: the press of a thumb, the scrape of a seashell, even the fur of a cat.</p>

        <p>Visiting Bau Truc village was also an experience. The village had been molding the same earth for centuries, steady as ever, carrying forward the resilient strength of Champa in jars, kilns, and the sweat of its potters. Believe it or not, the Cham never relied on potter’s wheels. They shape their clay with their whole bodies, kneading through centuries of patience and endurance. In my work, I strive to mirror that simplicity and ingenuity, letting my Vietnamese spirit ripple gently through every pattern and motif.</p>
